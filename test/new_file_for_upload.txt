This is a new test file created specifically to test the Rich progress bar upload functionality.
It needs to be long enough to actually see the progress bar in action.
Here are some more lines to make it bigger:
Line 4 with some content to increase file size
Line 5 with more text and data
Line 6 continuing to add content
Line 7 with even more text to make this file larger
Line 8 adding more content for testing purposes
Line 9 with additional text content
Line 10 final line to complete the test file
